        #   Analysis of the Health Network of Metropolitan Lima Against Large-Scale Earthquake.
        description: | 
          Peru is a highly seismic country located in the Ring of Fire, making it vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. 
          In the present work, we examined Lima's health system capacity from three different and complementary points of view. 
          This document aims to provide elements for the strengthening of the Peruvian fragile health system.

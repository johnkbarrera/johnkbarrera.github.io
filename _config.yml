        description: |
          Peru is a highly seismic country located in the Ring of Fire, making it vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. 
          This research examines Lima's health system capacity from three different and complementary perspectives, 
          utilizing graph theory, geographic information systems, and simulation modeling.
          
          **Key Contributions:**
          - Multi-dimensional analysis of health network resilience
          - Accessibility modeling under disaster scenarios
          - Policy recommendations for health system strengthening
